###Chat Client for COSC 331 in RUST

This is a simple client that was made through the help of a guide on the internet by TensorProgramming

I was trying to make this on my own by learning the language, because I felt like the learning this langauge would be fun and rewarding. unfortunately I never got far enough to be able to program it properly into this state that it was in so I owe a lot to the guide for helpign me figure it out.:x
